As believers in open-source, it's imperative for us to use open-source
tools to manage our code. GitHub does not meet this requirement, hence
we are shifting away from the platform. 

Select projects on this account are available as source code in
[Advaith's personal website](https://people.devinivas.org/~madvaith1/).

Onlookers unaffiliated with the authors of any of the projects can
download past open-source projects affiliated with AMSDC, AKNP Solutions,
vsmea, and other sister organizations from Ad's website. Note that not all
projects are available - those deemed incomplete or unsupported will
NOT be uploaded either to Ad's website or the DOSA server, and should be
obtained from internet archives.

Repositories which were used for team projects (both high school and
college) are available in both source code and Git repository form. 
If the souce code for a team project is not available on Ad's website,
it is likely that it is not allowed to share the code for the project
publicily due to copyright laws. With those terms in mind, the source code
can be shared for personal use only - redistributing this source code
could be a violation of trademark and copyright law. Should a member of such a
team need the repository with commit history available as a link, they
will be shared a link to the Devi Nivas Open-Source Applications (DOSA)
GitLab server, whenever it is ready.
